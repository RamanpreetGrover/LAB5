I made a main HTML with a heading and nav bar. I created CSS with Google Customs font and linked external HTML to the main.

I reached a significant milestone by completing the header and nav bar styling. Additionally, I added a visually appealing gradient text to the main section of the website.

I added another HTML called genres.html, added an accordion, formatted it, and added an image with relative properties. Css completed for this HTML

Completed another HTML named artists.html and completed the CSS sheet for the same. I made this different from the initial CSS as the background colour for the page is different, and I used interactive images, transitioning effects and more hover properties.

I added the final HTML named instruments.html and CSS. This uses an embedded video link with transitioning and interactive photos.
